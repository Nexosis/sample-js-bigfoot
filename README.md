# The Impact of Television on Bigfoot Sightings

This is the sample JavaScript code for the Nexosis tutorial on _The Impact of Television on Bigfoot Sightings_.

Note: The code in the repository contains much duplication. This is deliberate. This is because it is intended to show how to use the Nexosis API and refactoring out the common code makes this more difficult to see from the samples. If you were writing actual production code, you could expect more of me.
